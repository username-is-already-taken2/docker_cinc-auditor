# Dockerfile to build cinc-auditor
This repo is used to host the Dockerfile to build a cinc-auditor container

This was based on the [original](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inspec/inspec/master/Dockerfile) one from the [inspec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) repo.

It's been amended to tweak the container size and swap out the binaries for the [cinc](https://cinc.sh) version [cinc-auditor](https://github.com/cinc-project/auditor)

# WARNING 
## As of this writing only cinc-auditor has not been formally evaluated for compliance. Use of this binary should be used only for testing at this time.

## Usage
